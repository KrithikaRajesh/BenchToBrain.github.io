    <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Krithika Rajesh, a Masterâ€™s student in Human Genetics with a passion for stem cells, brains, and asking way too many questions.</p>
      

<p>My interest in Parkinsonâ€™s started close to home â€” my grandmotherâ€™s journey with it lit the spark. Since then, Iâ€™ve been diving into stem cell biology, hoping to someday use it to understand and maybe even treat neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
      

<p>Iâ€™m still early in the game, learning, experimenting, and slowly building the skills I need to take on big brain problems. This blog is where I share that journey â€” one pipette at a time.</p>
      

<p>â€”Â KrithikaðŸ§ Â </p>
