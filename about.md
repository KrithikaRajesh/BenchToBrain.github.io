I'm Krithika Rajesh, a passionate researcher with a Master's in Human Genetics and a deep commitment to unraveling the mysteries of neurodegenerationâ€”especially Parkinson's disease.

With a foundation in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, I aim to bridge the gap between fundamental research and real-world therapies. My experience spans ADMSC culture, senescence studies, PCC induction, and disease modeling, fueled by both academic rigor and personal drive. This blog is a space to share insights, breakthroughs, and reflections on the journey from petri dish to patient care.
