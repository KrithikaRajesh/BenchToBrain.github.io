Hey! Iâ€™m Krithika. I just finished my Masterâ€™s in Human Genetics, love brains, and Iâ€™m mildly obsessed with stem cells.
This blog? Just a place for me to scream into the scientific void with purpose.
Letâ€™s begin at the beginning:

## Why Parkinsonâ€™s? Why me?

Spoiler alert: Itâ€™s personal.

I didnâ€™t stumble into neuroscience because I thought brains were cool (they _are_, obviously). I got into this because of a woman with the warmest hugs, sharpest wit, and a hand that started to shake one day â€” my grandmother.
Parkinsonâ€™s didnâ€™t come in loud. It snuck in slowly, stealing her steadiness and spark in tiny, quiet pieces. It was frustrating. It was heartbreaking. It was also the moment I realised I wanted to fight back. Not with swords (although that would be awesome), but with science.

## From crying over cells to culturing them

Fast forward a decade, now Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Human Genetics, neck-deep in cell culture flasks and pipettes, obsessing over stem cells like theyâ€™re the latest Marvel franchise.
Stem cells are magic â€” sort of (except when they decide to die on you).
Theyâ€™re shapeshifters. Theyâ€™re problem solvers. And theyâ€™re our best shot at rebuilding what Parkinsonâ€™s tears apart.
I have worked with adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, done differentiation assays, and spent a mildly concerning amount of time thinking about âœ¨**neuronal regeneration**âœ¨. Basically: Iâ€™m training to become a neuro-nerd vigilante, powered by science (and coffee).

## Why this blog exists

I needed a space where I could talk about:
- My research journey (aka, the emotional rollercoaster that is science)
- Cool breakthroughs around the world in Parkinsonâ€™s and regenerative medicine
- Big questions, small wins, and occasional mental breakdowns
- The why behind the work
Hence: **Bench to Brain.**
Because what starts at the bench can (hopefully) change a brain someday.

So, if you're someone who loves neurons, stem cells, or just wants to watch a hopeful genetics student try to science her way into curing Parkinsonâ€™sâ€¦ stick around.
This is going to be weird, wonderful, and 100% real.
