 
# Things I Didn’t Expect to Learn From My Master’s Project
Date: 2025-07-06
## *From Clueless Cultures to Confidence (Kind Of)*
---

When I started my master’s research, I thought the learning would be mostly technical — understanding protocols, running assays, generating data, maybe interpreting some graphs.
What I didn’t expect was how much I’d change in the process.

While I was trying to figure out how resveratrol affects cellular senescence in adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSCs), I was also learning a hundred other things — most of which weren’t written in any lab manual.

## I Had No Experience with Cell Culture — And It Showed
I stepped into the lab on day one with zero hands-on experience in culturing cells.
No clue how to hold a flask.
No muscle memory for pipetting under a hood.
No instinct for when cells were “happy” or “stressed.”

Everything felt awkward and unfamiliar — like I was trying to babysit a pet I didn’t understand.
Especially since everyone else seemed to know more than I did.

But slowly, I began to get it.
I learned how to handle flasks confidently, how to tell if my media looked off, and how to trust what I was seeing under the microscope.
Each passage taught me something new — not just about the cells but about myself.

## It Wasn’t Just Science — It Was Adaptation
At first, every task felt like a test.
But over time, I began to anticipate what came next — how to plan media changes, manage time in the culture room, organize experiments, and troubleshoot on the fly.

The rigid SOPs turned into flexible workflows.
The girl who didn’t like staying a minute overtime was staying back hours — not because she had to, but because she wanted to.

And I realized that research isn’t about memorizing steps — it’s about adapting when the steps don’t go as planned.

## The Emotional Learning Curve
There were moments of panic.
And frustration.
And that one week where everything seemed to go wrong back-to-back.

But somewhere between the failures and mini-victories, I became more resilient.
I learned how to be patient when things took longer than expected.
How to stay calm when something didn’t work.
How to be okay with not knowing everything right away.

And that mindset shift?
Probably the biggest win of all.

## Looking Back Now
This project didn’t just teach me about senescence markers or antioxidant effects.
It taught me:

* How to work with living systems that don’t always behave as expected.

* How to think critically when things don’t go as planned.

* How to stay grounded, even when my experiments weren’t.

It made me curious.
Confident.
And most of all, it made me excited to keep learning.

To Anyone Just Starting Out
It’s okay to not know anything when you begin.
What matters is showing up. Asking questions. Trying again.

Your flasks might be quiet, but the growth happening in you is *loud.*
And one day, you’ll realise: you didn’t just finish a project.
You built a whole new version of yourself in the process.
