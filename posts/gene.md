# 🧬 Is It In Your Genes?
## What Causes Parkinson’s Disease (And What Doesn’t)
We often think of diseases as either inherited or random. But Parkinson’s? It's a little bit of both, and a whole lot more complicated. Welcome to the curious case of Parkinson’s Disease, where genetics, environment, and just plain bad luck all seem to shake hands.

## [🧠 What Is Parkinson’s, Again?](https://krithikarajesh.github.io/BenchToBrain.github.io/posts/view.html?post=next.md)
Parkinson’s is a neurodegenerative disease where brain cells that produce dopamine slowly start to die off. Dopamine is crucial for movement, mood, and coordination. When it's depleted, symptoms like tremors, stiffness, and slowness creep in. But what sets this whole process in motion?

## 🧬 Genetics: The Code We’re Born With
Only about **10–15%** of Parkinson’s cases are considered “familial,” meaning they run in families. The rest? They’re sporadic, with no obvious inheritance pattern.

But science has spotlighted some genes that *can* raise your risk:

* [LRRK2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-023-00544-7) – The most common genetic contributor to Parkinson’s, especially in certain populations.
* [SNCA](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8401994/) – Encodes alpha-synuclein, the protein that clumps into Lewy bodies in Parkinson’s brains.
* [PINK1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4764997/), [PARK7 (DJ-1)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38391909/), [PRKN](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38767677/) – Usually linked to early-onset cases. These genes are like cellular janitors: damage piles up when they don’t work.

Bottom line: Having a mutation doesn’t *guarantee* Parkinson’s, but it might load the genetic dice.

## ☣️ Environmental Factors: The World Around Us
Not all causes are hidden in our DNA. Sometimes it’s what we breathe, touch, or eat that nudges the disease forward.

* [Pesticide exposure](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/research/research-blog/research-explained/pesticides-and-parkinsons) (like paraquat or rotenone) has been repeatedly linked to increased risk.
* [Heavy metals](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9774122/) such as manganese or lead may contribute to oxidative stress in brain cells.
* [Air pollution](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9119911/) and even [well water](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8687678/) (in certain regions) have been investigated as triggers.
  
In these cases, it’s less about *inheritance* and more about *exposure.*

## ⚖️ So… Is It Genetic or Not?
The truth lies in a **multifactorial** model. Think of it as a seesaw:

* One side is your *genetic risk* - the DNA you were born with.
* The other side is your *environmental exposure* - the life you live.




Caption – The more weight you have on either side, the more that balance tips toward disease. 

In many people, it’s not just one massive push; it’s a slow build-up over time.

## 🧩 Why This Matters
Understanding the *why* behind Parkinson’s is more than academic. It helps us:
* Identify people at higher risk
* Develop targeted therapies
* Guide prevention strategies
  
So no, it’s not *just* in your genes. But your DNA might be whispering part of the story, and science is learning to listen.
